# My first Dapp on the Ethereum Blockchain, a DEX

A DEX is a decentralized exchanged. I am working to create a decentralized app(dApp) on the Ethereum blockchain. Join me on this journey

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
GAS_REPORT=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
