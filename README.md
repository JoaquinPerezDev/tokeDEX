# My first Dapp on the Ethereum Blockchain, a DEX

A DEX is a decentralized exchanged, created as a dApp on the Ethereum blockchain. In this DEX, you'll be able to deposit and withdraw tokens, place buy/sell orders, cancel orders, check your balance, transaction history through the order book and get a comprehensive history of price action through a detailed candlestick price chart.

Updating and building this on the daily.
